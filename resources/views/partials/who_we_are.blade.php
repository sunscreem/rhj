                                    <p>Hello! I am Ross Johnstone and I started RHJ Contracts in 2009. My main objective at that stage was to compete in the market place in order to grow the business. I found this difficult to begin with, but as I became more experienced and increasingly aware of bad customer service and poor quality craftsmanship that I was seeing in the contracting industry, it became clear to me that there was a place in market place for me.</p>
                                    <p>My business, based mainly in Edinburgh, has grown rapidly since then, which I believe is due to the excellent craftsmanship and positive feedback, which I receive from customers.</p>
                                 </div>
                                <div class="col-md-6">
                                    <p>This has given the company a secure base to continue and to ensure the excellent quality and craftsmanship, which is central to our continued success in this competitive market.</p>
                                    <p>We are proud members of the Construction Industry Training Board (<a href="http://www.citb.co.uk/" class="underline">CITB</a>) who set the standards for the skills for all my staff.</p>
                                    <p>Over the last few years I've continued to support the growth of the business by offering an apprenticeship program which has been extremely successful in bringing on new team members.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Our Values:</strong> Customer Care, Quality and Safety, Integrity, Inclusiveness, Development and Teamwork and Communication.</p>
